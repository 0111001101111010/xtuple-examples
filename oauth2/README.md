oauth2-examples
===============

Example code on how to integrate with xTuple ERP's OAuth 2.0 Server.

xTuple has created [A Basic OAuth 2.0 Client Example Web Server App]
(https://github.com/xtuple/oauth2-client-example) in PHP that uses the
"Web Server" scenario.

xTuple has created the [JSON Web Token (JWT) Bearer Token Encoding and Decoding App]
(https://github.com/xtuple/jwt-encode-decode-app) that is very useful when
learning how to work with JWTs.
