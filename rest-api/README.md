=================

Example code on how to integrate with xTuple ERP's REST API.

See each directory for examples in different languages.

xTuple has created the [JSON-Patch Apply / Generate Diff App]
(https://github.com/xtuple/json-patch-app) that is very useful when
learning how to work with JSON-Patch which is requested for the PATCH method
and returned by the POST method of the REST API.
